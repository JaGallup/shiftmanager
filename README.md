# NOTICE

THINGS HAVE MOVED AROUND.

You probably want to look at
[shiftmanager-simple](https://github.banksimple.com/klukas/shiftmanager-simple),
a project that provides nice wrappers for using shiftmanager with Simple's
Redshift setup.

We're trying to clean this repo up to get the project to a state where
it's ready to release publicly.
